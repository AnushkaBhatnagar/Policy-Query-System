Guidelines to Maintaining Status (Students)

You have come to Columbia to pursue academic objectives and that's where your focus belongs. By being aware of and complying with the following regulations, you will avoid problems that can interfere with your program of study.

How to Maintain Your Lawful F/J Student Status

[RULE:ISSO:ARRIVAL-001]
1 Report your first arrival at Columbia with the SEVIS Report form. Please follow the instructions at Reporting Your Arrival in the first week. This will activate your SEVIS record. It's mandatory!
[/RULE]
[TIMING:within first week]
[CONSEQUENCE:SEVIS record not activated]

[RULE:ISSO:ENROLLMENT-001]
2 Register for full-time enrollment every fall and spring semester. If the summer term is a required part of your academic program, you must register full-time. If not, it is considered a vacation period and is optional. Use the scheduled registration dates on the Registrar's webpage. Full-time enrollment may differ from school to school, but generally it is:
12 points for Columbia schools and programs that use the credit point system for registration (except for Law and Social Work), OR
one residence unit for schools/programs using the RU system
[/RULE]
[CONFLICT-POTENTIAL:varies by school]
[SEE-ALSO:PhD_SEAS:REG-001,GSAS:REG-001]

If you're not sure if you're enrolled full-time, check your enrollment status at Student Services Online (SSOL) or check with your school.

[RULE:ISSO:ONLINE-001]
Online classes: You can count only ONE online class toward your minimum number of credits required for your full-time enrollment. For example, you can take one online 3-credit course toward the 12-credit minimum. If you want to take an additional online class for a 15-point course load, it is permitted because it's beyond the minimum required for full-time status. If you only need one course to complete your program of study in your final term, the course cannot be online or distance learning.
[/RULE]

[RULE:ISSO:NEW-PROGRAM-REENTRY-001]
As long as you have the new I-20/DS-2019 for the new program, you can re-enter the U.S. at any time. This is because:

[/RULE]

Visa Validity

[RULE:ISSO:NEW-PROGRAM-VISA-001]
You may continue to use an unexpired F/J entry visa.

If your visa has expired, the new I-20/DS-2019 establishes the continued validity of your F/J status while you remain in the U.S., but the first time you travel outside the U.S. (except to Canada or Mexico), you will need to apply for a new F/J visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate.

You do not need to pay another SEVIS fee because it is the same SEVIS record. Have your SEVIS fee receipt with you when you need to apply for a new visa.

[SECTION:OPT-INTRO]
What is OPT?

[RULE:ISSO:OPT-DEF-001]
OPT (Optional Practical Training) is a benefit of F-1 student status that allows you to work off-campus in your field of study to gain practical experience.
[/RULE]
[APPLIES_TO:F-1 only]

Before You Apply

When you can use OPT

[RULE:ISSO:OPT-WHEN-001]
You may use OPT during and/or after your degree program if it is longer than one academic year (2 semesters). OPT during your program is referred to as Pre-Completion OPT.
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:program longer than 1 academic year]

[RULE:ISSO:OPT-TWOPART-001]
Obtaining OPT employment authorization is a two-part application

Part 1. Submit an online application to the ISSO to obtain a new I-20 with the OPT recommendation printed on it.

Part 2. Submit your OPT application with fee to USCIS (Citizenship and Immigration Services). It may take USCIS three months (or maybe more) to process your EAD (Employment Authorization Document), so you need to plan ahead--and apply as soon as possible. See "When to Apply" below.
[/RULE]
[TIMING:3+ months USCIS processing]

[RULE:ISSO:OPT-APPLY-TIMING-001]
When to apply

By regulation, the earliest you may apply for pre-completion OPT is 90 days before your requested OPT start date. We recommend requesting a start date a few weeks earlier than the actual date you want to begin employment because of the unpredictable processing time of the EAD by USCIS. An earlier submission and an earlier approved start date builds in more time for any delay.

We encourage you to apply to the ISSO as early as possible for the OPT I-20 because you need it for the OPT application you will submit to USCIS.
[/RULE]
[TIMING:earliest = 90 days before start]

[RULE:ISSO:OPT-IN-US-001]
You must be in the U.S. at the time you submit your OPT application to USCIS

F-1 regulations require you to be in the U.S. in F-1 status at the time you apply for OPT. Your most recent I-94 admission record is among the required documentation.
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:physical presence in US]

[RULE:ISSO:OPT-DURATION-001]
You have a maximum amount of OPT time for each degree level

You get 12 months of OPT for each higher degree level you complete (Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD Degree).

If you're a student in certain STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math), you may be eligible for an extension of OPT for an additional 24 months.
[/RULE]
[DURATION:12 months per degree level]
[EXCEPTION:STEM = +24 months]

[RULE:ISSO:OPT-PRECOMP-DEDUCT-001]
OPT time used during your program is deducted from post-graduation OPT

Pre-Completion OPT is deducted from the 12 month total at graduation.
[/RULE]

[RULE:ISSO:OPT-ONCAMPUS-001]
On-Campus Employment. You are allowed to work on-campus through the program end date listed on your I-20. Any employment following the completion of the degree, including work for and paid by Columbia University, must meet OPT employment guidelines.
[/RULE]
[TIMING:through program end date]
[RESTRICTION:post-completion = must meet OPT guidelines]

[RULE:ISSO:OPT-ONCAMPUS-NO-DEDUCT-002]
On-campus employment does not get deducted from OPT after graduation

If you find on-campus employment, you don't need to apply for OPT. Your F1 status allows you to work on-campus, regardless of whether it's related to your field of study, and is not deducted from the time you're allowed to work under OPT. Review our information on On-Campus Employment.
[/RULE]

[RULE:ISSO:OPT-NO-OFFER-001]
You do not need an offer of employment to apply

You do not need a job offer to apply for OPT but if you don't work you forfeit the authorized OPT time.
[/RULE]

Time Limits (Part-time and full-time)

[RULE:ISSO:OPT-PRECOMP-HOURS-001]
Part-Time is 20 hours or fewer per week. You are limited to part-time hours during the fall and/or spring term. You are also limited to part-time during the summer if:
your program has a required summer term OR
summer is your final term

Full-Time is more than 20 hours per week. You may be full-time during the summer vacation period only if you will be continuing in the fall and summer is not a required term.
[/RULE]

Remote Work

[RULE:ISSO:OPT-REMOTE-001]
OPT is work authorization in the U.S. for a U.S. based employer. That being said, we have seen U.S. employers allow or require for F-1 OPT students to work remotely. If traveling internationally while working remotely, entry into the US is always up to Customs and Border Protection. As such, ensure you consider that the longer you are outside the U.S., the more scrutinized your entry may potentially be.
[/RULE]
[CAUTION:extended absence scrutiny]

[SECTION:OPT-POST]
F-1 OPT (Optional Practical Training) After Your Degree Program

Many students decide to remain in the U.S. after graduation to apply their skills and knowledge and gain practical experience and training. OPT (Optional Practical Training) is commonly used by students in F-1 status to achieve this objective.

What is OPT?

[RULE:ISSO:OPT-POST-DEF-001]
OPT (Optional Practical Training) is a benefit and extension of F-1 student status that permits you to remain in the U.S. after you complete your academic program with permission to work in your field of study.

Post-Completion OPT extends your F-1 status although you are no longer an enrolled student, and also extends the F-2 status of any dependents who are with you.
[/RULE]

Eligibility

Before You Apply

[RULE:ISSO:OPT-POST-IN-US-001]
You must be in the U.S. at the time you submit your OPT application to USCIS

F-1 regulations require you to be in the U.S. in F-1 status at the time you apply for OPT. Your most recent I-94 arrival record is among the required documentation.
[/RULE]

Types of employment allowed

[RULE:ISSO:OPT-POST-EMPLOYMENT-001]
Employment on Post-completion OPT is paid or unpaid work in your field of study for at least 20 hours per week.
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:minimum 20 hours/week]
[REQUIREMENT:field of study related]

Learn about types of employment allowed:

Type	Description
Paid employment	You must work at least 20 hours per week when on post-completion OPT.
Unpaid employment	Unpaid work must be at least 20 hours per week and the work cannot violate any labor laws. Learn more about this on our unpaid internships and volunteering webpage Be prepared to provide evidence from the employer that you worked at least 20 hours per week during the period of employment.
Please note: STEM OPT extension requires paid employment.
Remote employment	OPT is work authorization in the U.S. for a U.S. based employer. That being said, we have seen U.S. employers allow or require for F-1 OPT students to work remotely. If traveling internationally while working remotely, entry into the US is always up to Customs and Border Protection. As such, ensure you consider that the longer you are outside the U.S., the more scrutinized your entry may potentially be.
Multiple employers	You may work for more than one employer, concurrently or one at a time. All employment must be related to your degree program.
Short-term multiple employers	Musicians and other performing artists should maintain a list of all "gigs", the dates and duration. If requested by DHS, you must be prepared to provide evidence showing a list of all gigs.
Employment through an agency or consulting firm	Also known as employment, temp, or staffing agencies. You are required to average at least 20 hours/week at the location where you are placed.
Self-employed business owner	You must be able to prove that you have the proper business license and that the business is related to your degree program. You may need to consult an attorney.
Independent contractor/ free-lance	If requested by DHS, be prepared to provide evidence showing the duration of the contract periods and the name and address of the contracting company.

[RULE:ISSO:OPT-POST-NO-OFFER-001]
You can apply for OPT without a job offer

A job offer is not required in advance of submitting an application which allows you more time to job hunt. However, you need to begin OPT employment within 90 days of the start date on your EAD.
[/RULE]
[TIMING:employment must begin within 90 days]

[RULE:ISSO:OPT-POST-UNEMPLOYMENT-001]
You are allowed a total of 90 days without employment on OPT

The "clock" to count unemployment days begins on the start date of OPT on your EAD card

✓	Employment must begin within 90 days from the start date on your EAD. If USCIS processes your OPT application after your requested start date, it may adjust the start date to the date your OPT was approved. The end date, however, will not be extended beyond 14 months from your I-20 completion date.
✓	The 90 days of unemployment is an aggregate of all days without employment, including weekends and time between jobs. (This does not include vacations or sick days taken while employed.)
✓	SEVIS keeps track of your unemployment days, based on the information you submit via OPT Reporting.

Be careful! If you accrue more than 90 days of unemployment, or if you forget to report and update your OPT to the ISSO, your F-1 SEVIS record may automatically terminate. A terminated SEVIS record cancels OPT authorization and requires you to leave the United States.
[/RULE]
[LIMITATION:90 days total unemployment]
[CONSEQUENCE:SEVIS termination if exceeded]
[TIMING:14 months max from completion date]

[RULE:ISSO:OPT-POST-MAXIMUM-001]
You have a maximum amount of OPT time. Your maximum amount of Post-Completion OPT is 12 months. If you had OPT previously authorized at the same degree level it will be deducted from the 12 month total. This includes:
✓	Any OPT authorized during your current program (Pre-Completion OPT)
✓	Any OPT authorized for another program at the same degree level

Use your previously-issued EAD cards to calculate the number of days to be deducted. Plan ahead for your application timeline. The earliest you can apply is 90 days before your program end date on your I-20. For more detail on the application timeline, go to Application Process Step 1. Keep records of all your employment. We recommend that you maintain evidence — for each job — of the position held, the job title, contact information for your supervisor or manager, a description of the work, and proof of the duration. If possible, obtain a signed letter from your hiring official, supervisor, or manager stating how your degree is related to the work performed. These records and letters are not part of your applications. It is useful to have them available in your personal files in case questions ever arise during OPT or in a future employment-based application. Do not travel if you plan to re-enter the US after your program end date. You must be in the US when submitting your I-765 application to USCIS and you cannot travel after the program end date until you have submitted your application to USCIS. Please review our travel information.
[/RULE]
[DURATION:12 months maximum]
[TIMING:earliest application = 90 days before end date]
[RESTRICTION:no travel after end date until application submitted]
