Doctoral Program Requirements

The primary focus of the doctoral program is research, with the philosophy that students learn best by doing—beginning as apprentices and becoming junior colleagues working with faculty on scholarly research projects. The faculty in the department conduct research in all areas of computer science. The doctoral degree requires a dissertation based on the candidate's original research, which is supervised by a faculty member, and all students in the doctoral program are actively engaged in research throughout the program.

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:PROGRAM-TYPE-001]
The PhD is the Computer Science Department's primary doctoral program. PhD students are expected to be full-time on-campus during every fall and spring academic semester from initial enrollment until the dissertation has been distributed to their defense committee, except during leaves of absence approved by the university. PhD students spend at least half of their time on research under the direction of their faculty adviser from their first day in the program and devote themselves full time to research after coursework and other preliminaries have been completed. PhD students are expected to participate in departmental and laboratory activities full time throughout the program, except for summer internships elsewhere, and the department does not consider admission of part-time PhD students. 
[POLICY:Outside Activities]
Students who are funded through a graduate research assistantship (GRA) must discuss with their advisor any research activities outside the lab as well as any consulting activities. [REQUIREMENT:GRA must discuss outside research with advisor] [REQUIREMENT:GRA must discuss consulting with advisor] GRAs should also discuss with their advisor any additional classes they intend to take, or any extra teaching/TAing, beyond those needed to fulfill the doctoral program requirements. [REQUIREMENT:GRA must discuss additional classes with advisor] [REQUIREMENT:GRA must discuss extra teaching/TAing with advisor] In addition to slowing degree progress, such outside activities may imperil progress on the externally-funded project supporting the student and subject the laboratory or advisor to unpleasant consequences from the grant agency or sponsor. [CONSEQUENCE:may slow degree progress] [CONSEQUENCE:may imperil funded project] [CONSEQUENCE:may cause grant agency issues] Courses taken for the breadth requirement, including any research activities as part of those courses, or teaching/TAing as part of the degree requirements, are not of concern. [EXCEPTION:breadth requirement courses exempt] [EXCEPTION:degree requirement teaching exempt]
Faculty who are approached by GRAs from outside their lab regarding additional research, teaching/TAing, classes, consulting, etc. should inform the advisor (both research and departmental advisors, if different). [REQUIREMENT:faculty must inform student's advisor when approached]
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:full-time on-campus every fall/spring]
[EXCEPTION:approved leaves of absence]
[EXCEPTION:summer internships]
[REQUIREMENT:half-time research minimum until coursework complete]
[REQUIREMENT:full-time research after coursework]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:APPLIES-ALL-001]
Unless otherwise stated, all doctoral program requirements apply equally to PhD, MS/PhD (until MS completed, when student becomes PhD) and DES students.
[/RULE]
[APPLIES_TO:PhD, MS/PhD, DES]

COURSES:

ALGORITHMS PREREQUISITE

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:ALGO-PREREQ-001]
Analysis of Algorithms is the core of Computer Science, which unites the many disparate subfields. All doctoral students are expected to complete an acceptable lecture course (graduate or upper-level undergraduate) in Analysis of Algorithms, with grade B+ or higher, prior to entering the program. 
Students must submit the prerequisite form by no later than two weeks (14 days) after the first day of classes of their first semester enrolled in the doctoral program. [TIMING:14 days after first day of classes] [REQUIREMENT:prerequisite form submission] The prerequisite does not count as one of the ten courses for the breadth requirement unless it meets all the requirements for imported electives, in which case students must also submit the Import Forms. [RESTRICTION:doesn't count toward 10 courses unless importable] [REQUIREMENT:Import Forms if counting toward breadth]
Sometimes new doctoral students are admitted without a prior Analysis of Algorithms course. Those students are required to complete CSOR W4231 during their first year in the program. [TIMING:first year] [REQUIREMENT:CSOR W4231 if no prior algo course] CSOR W4231 is then treated as one of the ten required courses, so can satisfy either the Theory distribution requirement or serve as an elective (not both). [OPTION:Theory distribution OR elective, not both] [RESTRICTION:cannot count for both distribution and elective] CSOR W4231 is the only course offered at Columbia that satisfies the Analysis of Algorithms requirement. [REQUIREMENT:only CSOR W4231 at Columbia]
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:grade B+ or higher]
[TIMING:prior to program OR first year]

BREADTH REQUIREMENT

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:BREADTH-001]
A total of ten distinct courses are required. All ten courses should be completed by the end of the fifth semester, at the pace of two courses per semester. An undergraduate Analysis of Algorithms course that satisfies the prerequisite does not satisfy the breadth requirement, only graduate lecture courses can be counted towards the breadth requirement. B+ ("PhD pass") is the minimum acceptable grade for doctoral students in all courses. A grade of B or lower is considered failure and does not count towards the course requirement. The same course may be repeated until the minimum B+ grade is obtained or a different course substituted. The average grade across all courses applied to the course requirement must be A- or higher.
In the case where a student takes the Analysis of Algorithms prerequisite at Columbia (CSOR 4231) rather than at another institution prior to enrollment, then it satisfies the Theory distribution requirement.
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:10 distinct courses]
[TIMING:by end of fifth semester]
[PACE:2 courses per semester]
[REQUIREMENT:graduate lecture courses only]
[GRADE:minimum B+ for each course]
[GRADE:average A- or higher]
[CONSEQUENCE:B or lower = failure]

DISTRIBUTION COURSES

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:DISTRIBUTION-001]
Doctoral students must complete at least four graduate lecture courses from the approved distribution course lists, including at least one from each of the Artificial Intelligence and Applications, Systems and Theory lists, and the fourth from any of these three approved lists. 
[APPROVED COURSE LISTS]
AREA: AI & Applications
APPROVED COURSES:
- All COMS 47xx courses except COMS 4721 and 479x
- All COMS 416x courses
- All COMS 417x courses
- CBMF 4761
[AREA:AI & Applications] [COURSES:COMS 47xx except 4721/479x, 416x, 417x, CBMF 4761]

AREA: Systems
APPROVED COURSES:
- All COMS 41xx courses except COMS 4121, 416x, 417x, and 419x

[AREA:Systems] [COURSES:COMS 41xx except 4121/416x/417x/419x, 48xx except 489x, 4444, CSEE 4119/4823/4824/4840/4868, EECS 4340]

AREA: Theory
APPROVED COURSES:
- All COMS 42xx courses except COMS 429x and CSOR 4246
- CSOR 4231
[AREA:Theory] [COURSES:COMS 42xx except 429x/CSOR 4246, CSOR 4231]

[RESTRICTION:4000-level only] [RESTRICTION:must be regular number, not Topics] [RESTRICTION:no seminars/project/reading/fieldwork courses] [RESTRICTION:no courses from other depts except specified joint-CS] [RESTRICTION:no summer session or Vxx sections] [RESTRICTION:no 5000-level or above] [RESTRICTION:no certificate-only or Data Science-only courses]

[APPROVAL PROCESS]
Instructors who are regular CS faculty may request that their course be included in one of the distribution lists, for AI & Applications, Systems, or Theory. [REQUIREMENT:instructor must be regular CS faculty] The course must be designated COMS (or jointly offered with CS, such as CSEE), 4000 level with a regular number (e.g., not 4295 or 4995), a conventional lecture course suitable for seniors and MS students as well as doctoral students, and already approved by the Academic Committee, full faculty, and relevant COIs (Committee On Instruction) for undergraduate CS majors and MS in CS students. [REQUIREMENT:COMS or joint-CS] [REQUIREMENT:4000-level with regular number] [REQUIREMENT:conventional lecture course] [REQUIREMENT:Academic Committee approval] [REQUIREMENT:full faculty approval] [REQUIREMENT:COI approval] The rationale for requiring a regular number, such as 4123, is that the Academic Committee will not approve a course for a regular number unless the instructor agrees to offer that course on a regular basis such as every year or every other year. [REQUIREMENT:must be regularly offered] An implicit criteria of doctoral distribution is that only regularly-offered courses are included on the list. In contrast, "Topics" course numbers are intended for only-once offerings. Although in practice many "Topics" sections are taught more than once, they are not expected to be offered reliably so that students can plan in advance on taking them.
The instructor, who must be regular CS faculty, should contact the Chair of the Academic Committee for information about applying for a regular course number and obtaining the various approvals. [PROCESS:contact Academic Committee Chair] Regular graduate lecture courses following the standard COMS numbering scheme, i.e., 41xx, 42xx, 47xx, 48xx, are then automatically included in the doctoral distribution requirement. [AUTO-APPROVED:standard COMS numbering] COMS and jointly offered courses not following the standard numbering scheme are considered by the Doctoral Committee on a case by case basis, normally only after they have already been added to the MS breadth requirement. [PROCESS:case-by-case for non-standard] Contact the Director of Graduate Studies (PhD Chair) for further information after the course has already been approved by the Academic Committee and the MS Chair. In rare cases, a "Topics" course may be listed temporarily because it has already been approved with a regular number at the 4k level but there is a delay before the bulletin and registrar course listings are updated. [EXCEPTION:temporary Topics listing during update delay]
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:4 courses from approved lists]
[REQUIREMENT:1 from AI & Applications]
[REQUIREMENT:1 from Systems]
[REQUIREMENT:1 from Theory]
[REQUIREMENT:4th from any of the three]



ELECTIVE COURSES

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:ELECTIVES-001]
In addition to the distribution requirement, all doctoral students must pass a total of six (6) elective graduate lecture courses, each three (3) or more points. Courses taken for fewer than three points do not count towards the breadth requirement, neither distribution nor electives. All electives require the advisor's approval.
Additional courses from the approved lists, beyond the four needed to satisfy the distribution requirement, may be taken as electives. Most other graduate lecture courses offered by the Computer Science Department (or offered by Computer Science jointly with other departments) may be taken as electives, including 4×95, 4995, 6×95, and 6998 Topics courses. Thus most COMS, CSEE, CSOR, EECS, MECS, CBMF, STCS courses are acceptable as CS electives, provided they are designated as graduate level. For COMS courses, this is 4k and above, but some Columbia departments consider 4k to be strictly undergraduate and only 5k and above are graduate.
At most two (2) electives may be outside CS.  That is, no more than two of the six electives may be graduate lecture courses offered by another department besides Computer Science, normally another STEM department (e.g., Electrical Engineering, Statistics).  At least four of the six electives must be Computer Science courses. Typically all six electives are Computer Science courses.
Regardless of the course number or offering department, however, courses labeled "certificate only" or "Data Science only", or named "xxx for Data Science" or similar, may not be applied to the doctoral breadth requirement, neither for distribution nor electives.
Project courses, such as COMS 4901, 6901, 9910 and 9911, and analogous courses offered by other departments, do not count towards the breadth requirement.  COMS E6910, ENGI 8000 and other fieldwork courses do not count towards the breadth requirement. 
Summer session and "Vxx" (Columbia Video Network) sections should not be taken while enrolled as MS/PhD, PhD or DES and normally cannot be applied to the doctoral breadth requirement. Such courses taken prior to enrolling in the doctoral program may satisfy parts of the breadth requirement, but the points from prior courses do not count towards the 30 points beyond bachelors required for MS/PhD and the additional thirty points beyond masters required for PhD and DES (these points are university-level requirements).
Some other departments at Columbia and elsewhere offer graduate courses on the same subjects as Computer Science courses. Students cannot apply two courses on the same subject to the ten course requirement whether taken in a Computer Science Department or in another department.
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:6 elective courses]
[REQUIREMENT:advisor approval]
[LIMITATION:max 2 from other departments]
[RESTRICTION:no project/fieldwork courses]
[RESTRICTION:must be graduate-level]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:DATA-SCIENCE-SPEC-001]
The Computer Science department and several other Columbia departments jointly offer a "data science specialization" for PhD students that requires additional courses. [PROGRAM:data science specialization] [REQUIREMENT:additional courses] [TYPE:optional specialization]
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:PASSING-GRADES-001]
The minimum passing grade for doctoral students in both distribution and elective courses is B+ ("PhD Pass"). [GRADE:minimum B+] [APPLIES_TO:distribution and elective courses] A grade of B or lower is considered failure. [CONSEQUENCE:B or lower = failure] The same course may be repeated in a later semester until the minimum B+ grade is obtained or a different course substituted, but repeated courses count only once towards the degree. [OPTION:repeat course] [RESTRICTION:counts only once] The average grade across the ten courses applied to the breadth requirement must be A- or higher. [GRADE:average A- or higher across 10 courses] If a student has less than average A- across the initial ten courses, additional courses (beyond the baseline ten courses) must be completed until the student attains A- average. [REQUIREMENT:additional courses if below A- average] All courses for the doctoral program must be taken for a letter grade, no pass/fail or "R" (audit) registration is acceptable. [RESTRICTION:letter grade only] [RESTRICTION:no P/F or audit]
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:COMP-EXAMS-PURPOSE-001]
Comprehensive exams ("comps") are cumulative final exams offered in some COMS courses (or jointly offered courses like CSOR, CSEE) primarily as an alternative to taking the corresponding course, and are intended for students who have already obtained the appropriate background and expertise, while enrolled in a prior Columbia program or at another institution, and/or feel confident in their ability to self-study the requisite material. [PURPOSE:alternative to taking course] [TARGET:students with prior background or self-study ability] Exams may also be taken by students who have completed the corresponding course with less than a "doctoral pass" (B+) grade, or are taking the course concurrently. [PURPOSE:retake for better grade OR concurrent]
A very small number of courses offer comps. [AVAILABILITY:very limited] Cumulative means the exam assesses the entire course. But to offer a final exam as a comp, it has to be more than cumulative: it also has to be suitable for students not currently enrolled in the course. [REQUIREMENT:suitable for non-enrolled students] Very few instructors are willing to offer such exams. [AVAILABILITY:very few instructors]
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:COMP-EXAMS-CREDIT-001]
Note that students do not receive Columbia points for passing a comp exam. [RESTRICTION:no Columbia points] To get credit, the student must register for the regular course and complete the entire course. [REQUIREMENT:must take course for credit]
It is important to note that passing a comp exam does not count as taking a course and cannot be substituted for taking a course. [RESTRICTION:doesn't count as course] Most significantly, students are required to complete six graduate lecture courses offered by the Computer Science department and taken for a letter grade to complete the MS/PhD (see MS Leading to PhD). [REQUIREMENT:6 CS lecture courses for MS/PhD] [SEE-ALSO:PhD_SEAS:MSPHD-APPROVAL-001]
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:COMP-EXAMS-SCHEDULE-001]
Every semester, the CS department announces which courses, if any, are offering comps about six weeks before the end of the semester. [TIMING:announced 6 weeks before semester end] Comps must be identical to and co-timed with the course's regular final exam, usually during the last week of classes or finals week. [TIMING:last week or finals week] [REQUIREMENT:identical to regular final]
Signup sheets for exams are normally made available through the PhD Program Administrator approximately six (6) weeks prior to exam administration, and students must normally sign up for all exams they intend to take at least four (4) weeks prior to the exams. [TIMING:signup 6 weeks before] [REQUIREMENT:commit 4 weeks before] Failure to show up for an exam, or leaving the exam without completion, is deemed de facto failure, unless the student presents acceptable evidence of illness or emergency to the Director of Graduate Studies. [CONSEQUENCE:no-show = failure] [EXCEPTION:illness/emergency with evidence] No "makeups" are offered, but the student may take the course or exam in a later semester. [OPTION:retake later semester]
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:COMP-EXAMS-STRUCTURE-001]
The comprehensive exam is the same as the final exam for the course and its administration is co-timed with that final exam. [REQUIREMENT:same as final exam] Each individual instructor can decide whether or not to offer a cumulative final exam for doctoral students. [AUTHORITY:instructor decides] Doctoral students who are not enrolled in the course can take the cumulative final and count that toward their course requirements if they pass with a B+ or better. [GRADE:B+ minimum to count] The exam must be a cumulative exam covering material from the entire course, not just the last half of the course since the midterm, and in no case may be less than one hour. [REQUIREMENT:entire course coverage] [TIMING:minimum 1 hour] Alternative structures such as project, team, oral, take-home, extended duration, etc. must be approved at least six weeks in advance by the full faculty on petition of the relevant area faculty. [EXCEPTION:alternative structures require faculty approval] [TIMING:6 weeks advance approval]
Other details such as pretesting, blind grading, open vs. closed book, etc., are at the discretion of the area faculty. [AUTHORITY:area faculty discretion]
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:COMP-EXAMS-RESPONSIBILITY-001]
A regular faculty member (in the department or formally affiliated) must be designated as responsible for each comprehensive exam. [REQUIREMENT:regular faculty responsible] The designated faculty member may optionally delegate to an adjunct (but not a student) the duties of preparing the syllabus, exam and grading scheme, but retains ultimate responsibility for adhering to the above rules. [OPTION:delegate to adjunct] [RESTRICTION:cannot delegate to student] [RESPONSIBILITY:faculty retains ultimate responsibility]
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:COMP-EXAMS-LIMITS-001]
Sometimes multiple sections of the same course may offer comp exams the same semester, but students may sit for only one comp per course. [RESTRICTION:one comp per course] Passing the exam (B+ or higher) satisfies the corresponding doctoral program requirement. [GRADE:B+ satisfies requirement] Sitting for an exam without finishing or submitting the exam is treated as de facto failure on the exam. [CONSEQUENCE:not finishing = failure]
If a student passes both the regular course and that course's comp exam, the course is only counted once towards the required ten courses. [RESTRICTION:course+comp = counts once] Multiple sections of the same course may offer comp exams during the same semester, but students are permitted to sit for only one of the exams and enroll in only one of the course sections; similarly, the course still counts only once for students who repeat the same course and/or exam different semesters. [RESTRICTION:only one section] [RESTRICTION:repeats count once]
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:PRIOR-COLUMBIA-COURSES-001]
Doctoral students who were previously enrolled in another program at Columbia, such as a different Doctoral program or an MS or BS/BA in Computer Science or a related field, may be able to count some of their previous Columbia courses towards the CS doctoral program. [APPLIES_TO:previous Columbia students] At most two non-CS courses can be included in the CS doctoral program but both electives for the MS/PhD must be CS. [LIMITATION:max 2 non-CS courses] [REQUIREMENT:MS/PhD electives must be CS] To be included:
The student's grade in the course must be B+ or higher. [GRADE:B+ or higher]
The course must be designated graduate-level by the offering department. For COMS courses, this is 4k and above, but some Columbia departments consider 4k to be strictly undergraduate and only 5k and above are graduate. [REQUIREMENT:graduate-level] [LEVEL:4k+ for COMS, varies by department]
The course must have been completed during the past five (5) academic years. [TIMING:within past 5 years]
Courses taken at Columbia do not need to be "imported". However, students should check with the PhD Program Administrator to make sure their previous courses have been added to their doctoral program record in mice. [PROCESS:no import needed] [PROCESS:check with PhD Program Administrator]
It is important to note that no additional Columbia credit ("points") are awarded for previous courses at Columbia and the previous credit does not count towards the points needed for the doctorate. [NOTE:no additional points] See the registration instructions for information about registering for credit towards the MS/PhD, PhD or DES.
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:IMPORT-DISTRIBUTION-RESTRICTION-001]
Distribution courses must be taken at Columbia and cannot be imported. [RESTRICTION:distribution must be at Columbia] However, some or all of the six electives may be imported from previous schools for students who enrolled in the doctoral program with a prior masters degree. [OPTION:electives can be imported with prior MS] However, students who enrolled for the PhD program without a prior masters degree should import at most four electives from a previous institution, since six graduate lecture courses offered by the Computer Science department must be taken at Columbia to complete the MS/PhD. [LIMITATION:max 4 imports without prior MS] [REQUIREMENT:6 CS courses at Columbia for MS/PhD]
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:IMPORT-DEADLINE-001]
Students must submit all Import Forms by no later than two weeks (14 days) prior to the last day of classes of their first semester enrolled in the doctoral program. [TIMING:14 days before last day of first semester] [The requirement that all imported courses must be approved for an elective during the student's first semester enrolled in the PhD program was approved by full faculty vote on 02/18/1998.] Doctoral students must use the pdf import forms posted on this page and submit the completed form via Mice in place of the "Syllabus". [PROCESS:use pdf forms via Mice] You will then assign this to "Phd-Chair" (not a specific professor or administrator's name). [PROCESS:assign to Phd-Chair]
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:IMPORT-BASIC-REQ-001]
To be acceptable for import:
The student's grade in the course must be B+ or higher. [GRADE:B+ or higher]
The course must be a graduate lecture course accepted for graduate credit towards a graduate degree in Computer Science at the offering institution and listed as a graduate course on the student's transcript from the offering institution. [REQUIREMENT:graduate CS course on transcript]
The course must have been completed during the past five (5) academic years. [TIMING:within past 5 years]
It is important to note that no Columbia credit ("points") is awarded for imported courses. [NOTE:no Columbia points] See the registration instructions for information about registering for credit towards the MS/PhD, PhD or DES.
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:IMPORT-DUPLICATE-RESTRICTION-001]
Students cannot import multiple courses on the same subject. [RESTRICTION:no duplicate subjects] Students cannot apply both an imported course and a Columbia course on the same subject to the ten course requirement. [RESTRICTION:import OR Columbia course, not both] If a student takes a Columbia course (or comp exam) equivalent to a course imported by that student, the student forfeits the imported course. [CONSEQUENCE:forfeit import if take Columbia equivalent]
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:IMPORT-DETAILED-CONDITIONS-001]
Courses taken outside Columbia cannot be imported unless all of the following conditions are met:
The course must fulfill all of the requirements for Doctoral electives. [REQUIREMENT:must meet elective requirements] [Revised by full faculty vote 12/17/20 to allow imports of non-CS courses. Effective immediately.] [REVISION:non-CS courses allowed as of 12/17/20]
The course must be a graduate lecture course accepted for credit towards a graduate degree in Computer Science at the offering institution and listed as a graduate course on the student's transcript from the offering institution. [REQUIREMENT:graduate CS course on transcript] An undergraduate course offered in the same room at the same time by the same instructor and graded on the same scale as a graduate course does not suffice: the student's prior institution must explicitly recognize the student's completion of the graduate course. [RESTRICTION:must be explicitly recognized as graduate]
The student's grade in the course was B+ or higher. [GRADE:B+ or higher] For those institutions that do not record plus and minus grades, a B is acceptable only if the student provides acceptable documentation that his/her grade was in the corresponding percentile of B+ or higher awarded in similar Columbia CS graduate courses. [EXCEPTION:B acceptable with documentation] Such documentation is also required to show B+ equivalence for institutions that grade on different scales (e.g., out of 10 points). [REQUIREMENT:documentation for different grading scales]
The course must be approved by the student's advisor (both research advisor and departmental advisor, if different). [APPROVAL:advisor approval required]
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:IMPORT-EVALUATION-001]
In addition to the advisor(s), the CS faculty member responsible for the most closely corresponding Columbia CS graduate course, or if there is no reasonably corresponding Columbia CS graduate course the CS faculty member deemed by his/her peers to demonstrate the most relevant expertise, has evaluated the course and presented a judgment in writing to the Director of Graduate Studies (DGS), and the DGS has concurred, that the imported course is considered of equal or higher quality and scope than the typical Columbia CS three-point graduate course, and the performance of the student is considered of equal or higher quality and scope than that required to obtain at least a B+ grade in a typical Columbia CS three-point graduate lecture course. [REQUIREMENT:CS faculty evaluation] [REQUIREMENT:DGS concurrence] [STANDARD:equal or higher quality than Columbia CS course] Note that "summer session", other shorter-than-usual courses, and/or courses awarding less than three points (or equivalent) usually would not meet these quality and scope guidelines and thus would not be importable. [RESTRICTION:summer/short courses usually not importable]
All materials requested by the evaluating faculty member and/or the DGS are provided, in English or notarized English translation. [REQUIREMENT:materials in English or notarized translation] The evaluating faculty member and/or DGS may, at their discretion, ask the student to provide oral or written answers to questions regarding the material learned in the course and/or may contact members of the institution at which the course was taken for additional information. [AUTHORITY:faculty/DGS may request additional info]
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:IMPORT-OLD-COURSES-001]
In the case of courses completed more than 5 years prior to formal enrollment, the evaluating faculty member must judge that the course is sufficiently relevant to the goals of the doctoral breadth requirement, and the DGS must concur. [TIMING:>5 years requires relevance judgment] [REQUIREMENT:faculty and DGS must concur on relevance] In particular, the subject covered by the course should not have changed significantly since the student took the course and the student evidently still retains mastery of the course material. [REQUIREMENT:subject hasn't changed significantly] [REQUIREMENT:student retains mastery]
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:IMPORT-NO-CREDIT-001]
Course imports are not treated as transfers and do not grant degree credit ("points"). [NOTE:no points awarded] The department offers credit in the COMS E9911 research course for the purpose of fulfilling the 30 points required for masters beyond the undergraduate degree, for students who enroll without a prior masters degree, and the additional 30 points required for the doctorate beyond the masters degree. [OPTION:E9911 for points requirement]
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:OUTSIDE-COURSES-ENROLLED-001]
Normally, any courses taken at another school after enrolling in the doctoral program cannot be counted towards the breadth requirement. [RESTRICTION:normally no courses after enrollment] In very rare cases, a student may take one graduate lecture course at another institution during his/her enrollment in the doctoral program and, with B+ or higher grade and advisor approval, apply it to the breadth requirement. [EXCEPTION:very rare, 1 course allowed] [REQUIREMENT:B+ or higher] [REQUIREMENT:advisor approval] This is permitted only when the advisor deems the course crucially important for the student's research and no equivalent course is offered by any department at Columbia. [CONDITION:crucially important and no Columbia equivalent] Full faculty approval is required in advance for a second or subsequent course. [REQUIREMENT:full faculty approval for 2nd+ course]
In the case of importing a course taken at another institution after enrolling in the doctoral program, the import procedure must be undertaken within two weeks after grades become available (or within two weeks of the student's return to Columbia, if absent when grades become available). [TIMING:within 2 weeks of grades]
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:SATISFACTORY-PROGRESS-BREADTH-001]
Satisfactory progress towards fulfilling the breadth requirement is defined as at least 2*N breadth course/exam passes, where N is the number of semesters enrolled thus far in the program, until the breadth requirement has been completed. [FORMULA:2*N courses by semester N] A doctoral student who has not made satisfactory progress towards the breadth requirement is normally placed on probation at the end of the first and/or subsequent semesters that he/she "falls behind". [CONSEQUENCE:probation if behind] The student can be immediately dismissed from the program at the end of any such unsatisfactory semester unless the full faculty accepts a petition from the advisor for one semester's grace. [CONSEQUENCE:dismissal possible] [EXCEPTION:one semester grace with faculty petition]
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:QUALIFIER-DEFINITION-001]
The doctoral program does not have a qualifier exam. [NOTE:no qualifier exam] Completion of the Analysis of Algorithms prerequisite together with all four distribution courses constitutes completion of "the qualifier". [DEFINITION:algo prereq + 4 distribution courses = qualifier] This definition of "the qualifier" is relevant only when a doctoral student needs to fill out external forms, e.g., for applying as a student volunteer and/or for student travel funds for a conference, or applying to attend a doctoral symposium at a conference, where the form asks whether the student has completed the qualifier. [PURPOSE:for external forms only] Students normally try to complete "the qualifier" during their first year in the program. [TIMING:typically first year]
[/RULE]

RESEARCH:

ADVISOR

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:ADVISOR-GENERAL-001]
All DES students and most MS/PhD and PhD students arrange a research advisor during the admissions process prior to enrollment, and work closely with him or her on directed research from their first day in the program. [TIMING:typically arranged before enrollment] Some doctoral students have two or more co-advisors. [REQUIREMENT:co-advisors allowed] All DES research advisors and most MS/PhD and PhD research advisors are tenured or tenure-track faculty members in the Computer Science Department. [TYPICAL:ToTT faculty as advisors] But in rare cases an MS/PhD or PhD student's research may be advised by a research scientist or an affiliated faculty member from another department, in which case the student must also have a departmental advisor who is a tenured or tenure-track faculty member in Computer Science. [EXCEPTION:non-ToTT requires departmental advisor] The departmental advisor is responsible for tracking the student's progress through doctoral program milestones, but is not responsible for the student's research or funding. [RESPONSIBILITY:track milestones not research/funding] Both research and departmental advisors are expected to represent their students at the Semi-Annual Review of all doctoral students held near the end of the fall and spring semesters. [REQUIREMENT:represent at Semi-Annual Review] [TIMING:end of fall/spring semesters]
Every doctoral student must have an advisor throughout the program. [REQUIREMENT:advisor throughout program]
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:ADVISOR-DES-001]
DES applicants are admitted only if the applicant was recruited by a tenured or tenure-track member of the Computer Science Department faculty who asked to be the student's research advisor. [REQUIREMENT:DES recruited by ToTT faculty] DES students must be advised by a tenured or tenure-track Computer Science faculty member throughout the program. [REQUIREMENT:DES ToTT advisor throughout]
[/RULE]
[APPLIES_TO:DES students only]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:ADVISOR-TIMELINE-001]
Most MS/PhD and PhD students arrange a "research advisor" (who will in most cases later become the thesis advisor) during the admissions process prior to enrollment, and work closely with him or her on directed research from their first day in the program. [TIMING:typically before enrollment] A few MS/PhD and PhD students (those funded by fellowships rather than GRAs) may be assigned only a nominal departmental advisor initially, and then must arrange a research advisor during their first year, normally by the end of their first semester. [TIMING:first year for fellowship students] [TIMING:by end of first semester preferred]
[/RULE]
[APPLIES_TO:MS/PhD and PhD students]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:ADVISOR-TYPES-001]
In almost all cases, an MS/PhD or PhD student's research advisor is a tenured or tenure-track faculty member appointed in the Computer Science Department at Columbia. [TYPICAL:ToTT CS faculty] In rare cases, an MS/PhD or PhD student's research advisor may be a lecturer or research scientist in the CS department, an officially approved "affiliated" faculty member in another department at Columbia, or a former CS faculty member who has left the department and/or the university, in which case the student must also have a "departmental advisor" who is a tenured or tenure-track faculty member whose primary appointment is in the CS department. [EXCEPTION:lecturer/research scientist/affiliated/former requires departmental advisor] [REQUIREMENT:departmental advisor must be ToTT CS faculty] The departmental advisor is responsible for reporting to the faculty on the student's progress through doctoral program milestones, but is not responsible for directing the student's research nor the student's funding. [RESPONSIBILITY:departmental advisor tracks milestones only] Both advisors are expected to represent their students at the Semi-Annual Review of all doctoral students held near the end of the fall and spring semesters and should participate in the same "review group". [REQUIREMENT:both advisors at Semi-Annual Review] [REQUIREMENT:same review group]
[/RULE]
[APPLIES_TO:MS/PhD and PhD students]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:SEMI-ANNUAL-REVIEW-001]
The full faculty holds an all-day meeting near the end of the fall and spring semesters to review the progress of every doctoral student. [TIMING:end of fall/spring semesters] [PROCESS:all-day faculty meeting] A draft review letter is composed for each doctoral student during the meeting. [PROCESS:draft letter during meeting] A student's letter states whether they are making "satisfactory progress" or "unsatisfactory progress", and specifies overdue or upcoming milestones and activities expected or required of the student. [CONTENT:progress status and milestones] The research advisor, and the departmental advisor if different, may edit the draft review letter and then approve finalizing the letter soon after the Semi-Annual Review (or within a time period determined at the Semi-Annual Review, e.g., when a milestone is scheduled to occur soon after the meeting or the student is taking courses whose final grades are not yet known). [PROCESS:advisor edits and approves] The finalized letter is signed by the Department Chair on behalf of the full faculty and sent via email to the student, with the research advisor, the departmental advisor (if different), and the secondary advisor cc'd. [PROCESS:Chair signs and emails] [RECIPIENTS:student, advisors cc'd] In the event that an advisor has not approved a student's review letter in a timely fashion, then the letter may be approved by either the Director of Graduate Studies or the Department Chair. [PROCESS:alternate approval by DGS or Chair]
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:RESEARCH-ADVISOR-ELIGIBILITY-001]
Each doctoral student must have a mutually agreed upon "research advisor" who supervises the student's research, including but not limited to the candidacy exam, thesis proposal and dissertation, as well as academic progress through the program's other requirements. [REQUIREMENT:research advisor supervises research] [SCOPE:candidacy, proposal, dissertation, academic progress] Co-advisors (two or more research advisors) are permitted and indeed encouraged, where both separately and jointly take full responsibility for the student's progress in the doctoral program. [REQUIREMENT:co-advisors allowed and encouraged] [RESPONSIBILITY:full responsibility for student progress]
All tenured and tenure-track (ToTT) faculty in the department are eligible to serve as research advisors. [ELIGIBLE:all ToTT faculty] Full-time teaching faculty, research scientists, and non-CS faculty members formally affiliated with the department may also serve as research advisors for MS/PhD and PhD students. [ELIGIBLE:teaching faculty, research scientists, affiliated faculty for MS/PhD and PhD] Former research advisors who have left their position with the department or the university may in rare cases be permitted to continue as research advisor. [ELIGIBLE:former advisors in rare cases] No one else is eligible to serve as a research advisor or co-advisor for a doctoral student. [RESTRICTION:only listed categories eligible]
To ensure that advising relationships are acceptable to the department, all research advisors arranged during the admissions process must be approved by the PhD Admissions Chair. [APPROVAL:PhD Admissions Chair for admissions process] All later advisor arrangements and changes must be approved by the Director of Graduate Studies. [APPROVAL:DGS for later arrangements] The Department Chair reserves ultimate authority for all advisor approvals. [AUTHORITY:Department Chair ultimate authority] In all cases, the PhD Program Administrator is responsible for verifying approvals. [PROCESS:PhD Program Administrator verifies]
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:DEPARTMENTAL-ADVISOR-ROLE-001]
Every doctoral student must also have a mutually agreed upon "departmental advisor" who is a current tenured or tenure-track (ToTT) faculty member in the Department of Computer Science at Columbia University. [REQUIREMENT:departmental advisor must be current ToTT CS faculty] When the research advisor is indeed ToTT faculty, then the research advisor is automatically the departmental advisor. [AUTOMATIC:ToTT research advisor = departmental advisor]
A separate departmental advisor is designated only when the research advisor is not a member of the department's ToTT faculty, e.g., an affiliated faculty member in another department. [CONDITION:separate only when research advisor not ToTT] In these cases, it is preferred that the departmental advisor be tenured. [PREFERENCE:tenured preferred] A departmental advisor may optionally serve as a co-advisor with respect to research advising. [OPTION:can serve as co-advisor]
The departmental advisor is obligated to keep current with the academic and research progress of the student throughout each semester, and represent the student during the Semi-Annual Review. [OBLIGATION:track progress and represent at review] It is expected that the departmental advisor maintains regular personal contact with the student, rather than just relying on email updates or academic records. [EXPECTATION:regular personal contact] Further, the departmental advisor is expected to consult with the research advisor both before and after each Semi-Annual Review – although all research advisors are invited to all Semi-Annual Review meetings and are expected to attend. [EXPECTATION:consult with research advisor before/after review]
Our main motivation in introducing the notion of a departmental advisor, in addition to the conventional research advisor – again only for those cases where the research advisor is not ToTT faculty – is to ensure that every student has an advisor who satisfies three conditions: [RATIONALE:ensures advisor meets three conditions]
The person regularly and routinely participates in the Semi-Annual Review – and not just dropping in for his/her own students or sending in email notes, but is actively aware of the general way things work, what good CS students accomplish, etc. [CONDITION:regular Semi-Annual Review participation]
The person is familiar with the CS doctoral program requirements and process and, at least as importantly, with some of the general reasoning as to why we do things in a certain way ("departmental culture"). [CONDITION:familiar with requirements and culture]
The person can and does participate in decisions about the program, e.g., by participating in program decisions in faculty meetings, the PhD committee, etc. [CONDITION:participates in program decisions]
Further, in the case where the departmental advisor is not the same as the research advisor, the two people shall co-sponsor the thesis proposal and dissertation committees. [REQUIREMENT:co-sponsor when separate from research advisor]
It is important to note that faculty members who take on the responsibility of serving as departmental advisor, but are not also the student's research advisor, are not incurring any financial responsibility for the student's support. [NOTE:no financial responsibility]
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:FIRST-YEAR-ADVISOR-EXCEPTION-001]
It is desirable in some cases for new MS/PhD and PhD students to choose their research advisor(s) after becoming accustomed to the department and familiar with the research programs of several faculty members and labs. [RATIONALE:allow time to explore labs] New MS/PhD and PhD students who do not enter with a pre-arranged research advisor shall be assigned a nominal departmental advisor at entrance. [PROCESS:nominal departmental advisor at entrance] The departmental advisor relationship is formalized before or during the first Semi-Annual Review following enrollment. [TIMING:formalized by first Semi-Annual Review] In some cases this may be delayed until (but no later than) the second Semi-Annual Review at the student's and/or prospective departmental advisor's request. [TIMING:may delay to second Semi-Annual Review] A research advisor, if different from the departmental advisor, must also be designated no later than the second Semi-Annual Review. [TIMING:research advisor by second Semi-Annual Review]
DES students cannot be admitted to or enroll in the doctoral program without a pre-arranged research advisor who is a current tenured or tenure-track (ToTT) faculty member in the Department of Computer Science at Columbia University. [REQUIREMENT:DES must have pre-arranged ToTT research advisor]
[/RULE]
[APPLIES_TO:MS/PhD and PhD students]
[EXCEPTION:DES must have pre-arranged advisor]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:LOST-ADVISOR-PROCESS-001]
Doctoral students who find themselves without either a research advisor and/or a departmental advisor, for whatever reason, should discuss the situation as soon as possible with either the Director of Graduate Studies or the Department Chair. [PROCESS:discuss with DGS or Chair ASAP] In most cases, the student will be obliged to find a mutually agreed-upon research advisor and a mutually agreed-upon departmental advisor within a reasonable period of time, usually by the following Semi-Annual Review. [TIMING:usually by next Semi-Annual Review] A nominal departmental advisor shall be appointed by the Director of Graduate Studies or the Department Chair on a temporary basis. [PROCESS:temporary nominal advisor appointed]
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:SECONDARY-ADVISOR-001]
All doctoral students are assigned a "secondary advisor" during their first semester and thereafter should have a secondary advisor throughout the program. [TIMING:assigned first semester] [REQUIREMENT:throughout program] The secondary advisor is independent of the research advisor and/or departmental advisor, and must be a regular tenured or tenure-track faculty member in the department who normally attends the Semi-Annual Review meeting and who agrees to discuss the student's formal notification of progress and status (i.e., the semi-annual review letter) as well as related issues as they arise. [REQUIREMENT:ToTT faculty who attends Semi-Annual Review] [PURPOSE:discuss review letter and related issues] The secondary advisor is normally arranged by the research advisor, but doctoral students may optionally select (or change) their own secondary advisor. [PROCESS:normally arranged by research advisor] [OPTION:student may select or change] The secondary advisor serves no other purpose than as a "second opinion", and does not incur any responsibility for the student's financial support or supervision. [PURPOSE:second opinion only] [NOTE:no financial responsibility]
Important note: The secondary advisor should be in the same "review group" as the student's research advisor and departmental advisor. [REQUIREMENT:same review group]
[/RULE]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:ADVISOR-ROLES-DISTINCTION-001]
The "secondary advisor" is intended to be another person for the student to go to about "what happened at the review meeting" and nothing else. [PURPOSE:discuss review meeting only] There are multiple situations and purposes where a "departmental advisor" may be assigned. Generally these purposes involve providing academic advice towards fulfilling the program milestones throughout the semester(s), not just immediately following a review meeting. [PURPOSE:ongoing academic advice on milestones]
[/RULE]

DIRECTED RESEARCH

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:RESEARCH-001]
The primary focus of our doctoral program is research, with the philosophy that students learn best by doing – beginning as apprentices and becoming junior colleagues working with faculty on scholarly research projects. All doctoral students are required to conduct productive research under the direction of their advisor throughout the program. For MS/PhD and PhD students, this should be half-time until completion of the coursework, teaching and candidacy exam requirements, and thereafter full-time until distribution of the dissertation. MS/PhD and PhD students are expected to participate in departmental and laboratory activities throughout all fall and spring semesters of the program. The policy on outside activities by MS/PhD and PhD students should be referred.
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:productive research throughout]
[REQUIREMENT:half-time until coursework/teaching/candidacy complete]
[REQUIREMENT:full-time thereafter until distribution]
[APPLIES_TO:MS/PhD and PhD]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:RESEARCH-MANDATORY-001]
The directed research requirement is never waived, regardless of funding source, including employer-supported DES students. Insufficient or inadequate research progress is deemed unsatisfactory progress: the doctoral student is normally placed on probation and can be immediately dismissed from the program. However, on appeal of the student's advisor, one semester's grace can be granted by the full faculty.
[/RULE]
[APPLIES_TO:all students including DES]
[CONSEQUENCE:probation or dismissal]
[EXCEPTION:one semester grace on faculty appeal]

COMMUNITY SERVICE

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:SERVICE-001]
The Department of Computer Science takes pride in maintaining a well-developed sense of community, and sees as an essential part of its doctoral program the preparation of its students for this important aspect of their future careers. It strongly encourages students to contribute a year of service to the department's professional, operational, or social needs, preferably during their second and/or third year in the program. A list of community service positions normally held by doctoral students is available in mice. The department confers several annual awards recognizing excellence in doctoral student service and teaching; further information and past awardees are here. The "phd reps" represent doctoral student concerns to the faculty, report on faculty meetings to doctoral students, and find volunteers for the community service program. More information about the current phd reps and what they do is here.
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:encouraged, not mandatory]
[TIMING:preferably year 2 or 3]

MPHIL FOR PHD STUDENTS

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:MPHIL-001]
The en-course degree of Master of Philosophy (MPhil) is conferred upon a PhD student who has satisfactorily fulfilled all milestones except the proposal and dissertation. This includes all courses, teaching, and candidacy exam. The MPhil also requires completion of six Residency Units (RUs) and sixty graduate points beyond the undergraduate degree. Two RUs and thirty points of advanced standing are granted for completing the masters degree. See the university requirements for the MPhil.

This is intended to be an informal document, not policy. In the case of any discrepancy between this chart and the written policy, the written policy shall apply.

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:MILESTONE-TIMING-001]
Note: All timing requirements ("N") are counted as semesters formally enrolled in the department's doctoral program, whether enrolled as PhD, MS/PhD or DES unless otherwise noted, referring to the end of the "Nth" semester. Semesters of formally approved "leave of absence" are not counted.
[/RULE]
[TIMING:counted as semesters enrolled]
[EXCEPTION:LOA not counted]

PhD Course Imports

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:IMPORT-001]
To qualify for Course Import review the course must meet the following minimum requirements:

The non-Columbia course being imported was completed within the past 5 years (there are some exceptions, see import policy here)
The non-Columbia course appears on the students' transcript and the student received a grade of B+ or better (or the student provides documentation demonstrating equivalence to a B+ grade at Columbia)
The non-Columbia course is a full-length course granting degree credit towards a graduate degree (masters and/or doctoral) in Computer Science at the offering institution
In the case of importing a course taken during the student's enrollment in the doctoral program, as opposed to before enrolling, there must be no equivalent course regularly offered at Columbia
[/RULE]
[TIMING:within past 5 years]
[GRADE:B+ or better]
[REQUIREMENT:full-length graduate CS course]
[CONDITION:if during enrollment, no Columbia equivalent]

PhD Algorithms Prerequisite

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:ALGO-IMPORT-001]

The non-Columbia course appears on the students' transcript and the student received a grade of B+ or better (or the student provides documentation demonstrating equivalence to a B+ grade at Columbia)
The non-Columbia course is a full-length course granting degree credit towards an undergraduate or graduate degree in Computer Science at the offering institution (if undergraduate, the course must be an upper-division course enrolling only juniors and seniors, and possibly graduate students as well, not sophomores or first-year students)
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:CS department course]
[GRADE:B+ or better]
[REQUIREMENT:upper-division if undergraduate]

Registration

This section is designed solely as a guide. For the official requirements, see the registration procedures in the GSAS and SEAS bulletins.

GSAS and SEAS often change their requirements and do not inform departments, so the information we have available to post may lag behind.

Registration can be done online only through Vergil or SSOL (Student Services Online). Registration instructions can be found on the Registrar's website. Note any information recorded in mice, e.g., your plans to take certain courses, does not automatically populate any university databases, you have to do that yourself.

QUESTIONS ABOUT DOCTORAL REGISTRATION? CONTACT:

MS/PhD, PhD and DES students contact the Doctoral Program Administrator at phd-advising@cs.columbia.edu.

GSAS VS. SEAS REGISTRATION

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:GSAS-SEAS-001]
The PhD is awarded by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS). PhD students who have already completed a Master's degree should register as GSAS students, and should normally register following GSAS registration policies (listed below). It is important to understand that SEAS rules override GSAS rules for PhD students whose home department is in SEAS, which includes the CS department.
[/RULE]
[OVERRIDE:SEAS rules override GSAS rules for SEAS departments]
[APPLIES_TO:CS department = SEAS department]
[CONFLICT-RESOLUTION:SEAS precedence]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:MSPHD-REGISTER-001]
Students who have not yet completed their MS degree are categorized as MS/PhD students and should register as SEAS (School of Engineering & Applied Sciences) students. MS/PhD students should register following SEAS registration policies (listed below) until they have completed the requirements of the MS degree. At that point, they will 'graduate' to GSAS.
[/RULE]
[APPLIES_TO:MS/PhD students]
[TRANSITION:to GSAS after MS completion]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:DES-REGISTER-001]
DES students remain in SEAS throughout the program.
[/RULE]
[APPLIES_TO:DES students only]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:CONTINUOUS-REG-001]
Both GSAS and SEAS require "continuous registration" every fall and spring semester unless a formal leave of absence is granted. Doctoral students are not required to register for the summer term.
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:continuous fall/spring registration]
[EXCEPTION:formal LOA]
[OPTIONAL:summer registration]
[SEE-ALSO:ISSO:ENROLLMENT-001,GSAS:CONTINUOUS-001]

GSAS ADVANCED STANDING

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:ADVANCED-STANDING-001]
GSAS requires all PhD students to complete 60 total points of graduate coursework and 6 Residence Units for the degree. Upon completing the MS degree in SEAS (or at another institution prior to enrolling at Columbia), GSAS will award students with 30 points and 2 Residence Units of advanced standing toward the PhD. Note: The standard 1 RU per semester accumulation (PhD_SEAS:GSAS-RU-001) does not apply during Master's coursework; RU accumulation begins only after completing the Master's degree, starting with the 2 RUs of advanced standing. Students only need to complete 30 additional points of graduate coursework and 4 Residence Units upon entering GSAS.
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:60 points and 6 RUs total]
[CREDIT:30 points and 2 RUs for prior MS]
[REMAINING:30 points and 4 RUs after MS]
[SEE-ALSO:GSAS:ADVANCED-STANDING-001]

SEAS REGISTRATION FOR MS/PHD STUDENTS

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:REG-001]
MS/PhD students should register for exactly 15 points every fall and spring semester. This maintains full-time status and will enable you to complete the 30-point requirement for the MS degree in one academic year. Courses graded P/F or taken for R credit (audit) do not count towards the degree, so please keep this in mind when registering. If you want to register for more than 15 points in a semester, please discuss first with your faculty advisor and then, if your advisor agrees, the Doctoral Program Administrator.
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:exactly 15 points per semester]
[APPLIES_TO:MS/PhD students]
[TIMING:fall and spring semesters]
[RESTRICTION:no P/F or R credit courses]
[EXCEPTION:>15 points requires advisor approval]
[CONFLICT-NOTE:specific to SEAS, differs from GSAS RU system]
[SEE-ALSO:ISSO:ENROLLMENT-001]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:REG-COURSES-001]
Step 1: Register for the lecture courses that you need to take that semester. MS/PhD students should complete two 3-point graduate lecture courses (6 points) per semester so they can complete the MS degree requirements in three semesters. Imports from other institutions, courses applied to a previous Columbia degree (BS or BA), comp exams, and research courses (9911) do not count towards the minimum six 3-point graduate lecture courses required for the MS degree. Satisfactory progress requires two (2) courses per semester until the breadth requirement has been completed.
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:2 courses per semester]
[TIMING:to complete in 3 semesters]
[RESTRICTION:imports/prior courses/comp exams/9911 don't count toward 6 course minimum]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:REG-9911-001]
Step 2: Register for your advisor's section of COMS E9911: Graduate Research II. The number of points of COMS E9911 that you register for depends on how many points of coursework you register for. Your points of coursework + points of COMS E9911 should total 15 points. So if you have registered for 6 points of lecture coursework, you should register for 9 points of COMS E9911. If you register for 4.5 points in lecture courses, you should register for 10.5 points of COMS E9911. If you aren't taking any lecture courses, register for the full (maximum) 15 points of COMS E9911. You must select the letter grade option for COMS E9911, otherwise the points will not count towards your degree.
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:coursework + E9911 = 15 points]
[REQUIREMENT:letter grade option for E9911]
[APPLIES_TO:MS/PhD students]

*The call number for your advisor's section of COMS E9911 may change each semester, and can be confirmed on our department's course listing. If you can't find the correct call number, contact the Doctoral Program Administrator.

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:REG-NO-9910-001]
Do not register for COMS E9910: Graduate Research I or any of the other project courses, such as W4901, E6900, E6901, E6902; those are only for undergraduates and MS students and cannot be applied to a doctoral degree.
[/RULE]
[RESTRICTION:no E9910 or project courses]

SEAS REGISTRATION FOR DES STUDENTS

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:DES-REG-001]
DES students need to register for at least three (3) points every fall and spring semester to maintain continuous registration.
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:minimum 3 points per semester]
[APPLIES_TO:DES students]
[TIMING:fall and spring]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:DES-REG-COURSES-001]
Step 1: Register for the lecture courses that you need to take that semester. Courses graded P/F or taken for R credit (audit) do not count towards the degree, so please keep this in mind when registering. Satisfactory progress requires two (2) courses per semester until the breadth requirement has been completed.
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:2 courses per semester]
[RESTRICTION:no P/F or R credit]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:DES-REG-9911-001]
Step 2: After completion of all coursework, or for any other semesters where you will not be taking courses, but have not yet embarked on your thesis research, register for three (3) points of your advisor's section of COMS E9911: Graduate Research II. You must select the letter grade option for COMS E9911.

You must complete at least thirty (30) points, with letter grades, in a combination of lecture courses and E9911 beyond the MS (or 60 points beyond the bachelor's degree).
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:3 points E9911 when not taking courses]
[REQUIREMENT:30 points total beyond MS]
[REQUIREMENT:letter grades]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:DES-REG-9800-001]
Step 3: When you start working on your thesis, you should instead register each semester for three (3) points your advisor's section of COMS E9800: Directed Research in Computer Science. You must complete 12 points in COMS E9800. These 12 points do not count towards the 30 points residence requirement.
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:3 points E9800 per semester during thesis]
[REQUIREMENT:12 points E9800 total]
[NOTE:E9800 points don't count toward 30-point requirement]

Further information is available from SEAS.

*The call number for your advisor's section of COMS E9911 and E9800 may change each semester.

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:DES-NO-PROJECT-001]
Do not register for COMS E9910: Graduate Research I or any of the other project courses, such as W4901, E6900, E6901, E6902; those are only for undergraduates and MS students.
[/RULE]

GSAS REGISTRATION PRIOR TO COMPLETION OF SIX (6) RESIDENCE UNITS

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:GSAS-RU-001]
PhD students in GSAS should register for one residence unit (RU) every consecutive fall and spring semester until they have accumulated six total RUs (including the two RUs obtained through advanced standing). The Residence Unit will give you full-time status. Make sure to keep track of exactly how many RUs you have completed as over-payment of RU tuition will not be refunded. You can see how many RUs you have completed in Vergil or SSOL. The call number for the RU is 99991.
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:1 RU per semester]
[APPLIES_TO:PhD students in GSAS]
[TOTAL:6 RUs including 2 from advanced standing]
[WARNING:no refund for over-payment]
[CONFLICT-NOTE:differs from SEAS point system]
[SEE-ALSO:GSAS:RU-001]

Step 1: Register for the RU using call #99991 in SSOL.

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:GSAS-COURSES-001]
Step 2: Register for the lecture courses that you need to take that semester. Courses graded P/F or taken for R credit (audit) do not count towards the degree, so please keep this in mind when registering. Satisfactory progress requires two (2) courses per semester until the breadth requirement has been completed.
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:2 courses per semester]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:GSAS-9911-001]
In addition to the four RUs, you will need to complete 30 points beyond the MS degree. These can be spread out over multiple semesters, and you may get all 30 points from taking courses. But if you are on your third or fourth RU and it does not look like you will have all 30 points by the time you complete the fourth RU, you should obtain the remaining points from taking COMS E9911: Graduate Research II.

In that case, as Step 3: register for your advisor's section of COMS E9911: Graduate Research II. The number of points of COMS E9911 that you will register for will be dependent on how many points of coursework you have registered for. Your points of coursework + points of COMS E9911 should come to no more than 15 points total in a given semester. So if you have registered for 6 points of lecture coursework, you can register for up to 9 points of COMS E9911. You must select the letter grade option for COMS E9911. If you aren't taking any lecture courses, you can register for the maximum 15 points of COMS E9911.
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:30 points beyond MS]
[LIMITATION:no more than 15 points total per semester]
[REQUIREMENT:letter grade for E9911]

*The call number for your advisor's section of COMS E9911 may change each semester, and can be confirmed on our department's course listing. If you can't find the correct call number, contact the Doctoral Program Administrator.

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:GSAS-NO-PROJECT-001]
Do not register for COMS E9910: Graduate Research I or any of the other project courses, such as W4901, E6900, E6901, E6902; those are only for undergraduates and MS students.
[/RULE]

GSAS REGISTRATION AFTER COMPLETION OF SIX (6) RESIDENCE UNITS

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:GSAS-POST-RU-001]
After you have completed your six residence units in GSAS, you should stop registering for RUs. How you register after that depends on several factors. There are two options, Extended Residence (ER) and Matriculation and Facilities (M&F).
[/RULE]
[APPLIES_TO:after 6 RUs completed]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:ER-001]
Extended Residence: Most students should register for ER after completing six (6) RUs. ER (or RU) registration is required for international students on a student visa to maintain full-time status and for any students to take courses, including COMS E9911, or to complete any degree requirements except the dissertation, defense and deposit. The GSAS rules for registering ER are posted here. Note those rules imply that students could register for M&F instead under various circumstances, e.g., while working on their thesis proposal, but M&F is disallowed by SEAS in most cases, see below.
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:ER for international students]
[REQUIREMENT:ER to take courses or complete requirements]
[EXCEPTION:dissertation, defense, deposit]
[CONFLICT-NOTE:GSAS allows M&F in some cases, SEAS restricts]
[SEE-ALSO:GSAS:ER-001]

Students who are unsure whether they should register for RU or ER should contact the Doctoral Program Administrator.

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:ER-COURSES-001]
You should register for any classes you are taking in addition to the ER unit. If you are done with RUs but have not yet completed 30 points beyond the MS, you should also register for COMS E9911 every semester for 1 to 15 points until you have completed 30 points beyond the MS degree.
[/RULE]

Students who are unsure whether they need to register for COMS E9911 or for how many points should contact the Doctoral Program Administrator.

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:MF-001]
Matriculation and Facilities: M&F registration maintains the "continuous registration" required by GSAS and is considerably less expensive than ER. While registered M&F, students may not take any courses, including COMS E9911, and must have already completed all degree requirements other than distribution, defense and deposit of the dissertation. M&F is not available to international students on a student visa, students funded by a TA or RA appointment, and students participating in internally or externally sponsored research. Students working solely on writing/revising their dissertation and/or preparing for distribution, defense and deposit, may register M&F during their last two semesters. The SEAS rules for registering M&F are available here. (Note SEAS rules contradict and override the GSAS rules posted here.) The SEAS rules disallow any stipend or compensation of any sort from any university source for students registered M&F.
[/RULE]
[RESTRICTION:cannot take courses including E9911]
[REQUIREMENT:all requirements except distribution/defense/deposit complete]
[EXCLUSION:international students on visa]
[EXCLUSION:TA/RA funded students]
[EXCLUSION:sponsored research participants]
[TIMING:last 2 semesters only]
[OVERRIDE:SEAS rules override GSAS rules]
[RESTRICTION:no university compensation while M&F]
[CONFLICT-RESOLUTION:SEAS precedence over GSAS]
[SEE-ALSO:GSAS:MF-001]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:MF-APPROVAL-001]
Faculty advisors of students who want to register for M&F should contact the Doctoral Program Administrator to check their student's academic eligibility. However, the Doctoral Program Administrator cannot handle the financial aspects, so the next step for academically eligible students is for the faculty advisor to contact the department's DFA to make financial arrangements.
[/RULE]
[PROCESS:academic eligibility check first]
[PROCESS:then financial arrangements]

GSAS REGISTRATION FOR THE DISSERTATION DISTRIBUTION, DEFENSE, AND DEPOSIT

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:DEFENSE-REG-001]
It is not necessary for US citizens or permanent residents to register during the semester of the thesis defense or deposit. However, all students must be registered during the semester in which the dissertation is distributed to the defense committee. For example, if you distribute in the fall, but defend in the spring, you only need to be registered for the fall semester.
[/RULE]
[REQUIREMENT:must register for distribution semester]
[EXCEPTION:US citizens/permanent residents need not register for defense/deposit]
[SEE-ALSO:GSAS:DEFENSE-REG-001,ISSO:ENROLLMENT-001]

[RULE:PhD_SEAS:DEFENSE-INTL-001]
International students should contact the International Students and Scholars Office (ISSO) to confirm whether they need to be registered for the defense and deposit, if these activities take place in a later semester than the distribution.
